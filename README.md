Zebra black with Inria fonts

=============

The original Zebra is a Keynote theme for research presentations by [Dr. shoya140](https://github.com/shoya140/zebra).

This theme is a modified version of Zebra's block.

The main differences are

1. Use Inria Sans for text fonts
2. Add page numbers at the top-right corner of the slide
3. Change the text bullets.

## System requirements

I tested the following versions:

- Mac OSX Catalina
- Keynote v10.0

## How to install

0. Install [Inria fonts](https://github.com/BlackFoundryCom/InriaFonts)
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `zebra.kth`
3. Select "Add to theme selector".
